Greenfield was once a bustling city. High-tech industry, a strong economy, friendly neighbors and a low crime rate made Greenfield a wonderful place to live. Then the dead rose and claimed the city for themselves.

Most of the city was overrun by the undead, but a few sanctuaries still exist. The most well-known is the Research Laboratory Vault which was taken over by the remains of Greenfield's national guard. The Vault takes in anyone willing to help take back the city. Some help repair generators and other machinery, some perform supply runs and reconnaissance missions while some do their part by preparing meals that don't remind the imbiber that civilization is dead with every mouthful.

When you show up to the Vault, you'd better be ready to earn your place. 





Hedra Tower
There is a tight-knit group in Hedra Tower, led by none other than Mr Hedra himself. Hedra's group seems to have plenty of weapons and ammunition, but lack food and medical supplies.

Mr Hedra will commission you with jobs and offer some big trades.

Jobs
- Mr Hedra is a businessman and will not deal with anyone without some business sense (must have 500 credits)
- Clean water is becoming harder to find. Mr Hedra sends you to JenniferM who explains they are in need of water and wish to trade credits or ammo for 25 bottles of water. Bring back the water for 750 credits or 250 12ga slugs.
- Now that there is enough water to last a few days food and medical supplies are needed, but this time we don't need to trade. Mr Hedra sends you to JenniferM who explains that a scout informed us of a shop that had more supplies than he could hope to carry. Specifically a crate of medical supplies. She gives you the coordinates and sends you to find the crate. Be sure not to open the crate yourself or you'll have to find another. Bring the supply crate to JenniferM to receive 500 credits or 250 9mm Ammo.
- Mr Hedra lets you know what an asset you've become recently. This next mission won't be a simple as the others. We're running low on energy cells and if the lights go out we'll be overrun with the undead. I know the vault has plenty of energy cells, but I don't want to pay the price they're asking for the amount that we need. Saxton Hale has gained some intel on the vault, speak to him. Saxton informs you the vault stores a stockpile of energy cells in the hallways of the living quarters. Snatch 100 energy cells and bring them back to Mr Hedra for 200 credits, 100 10mm Ammo or keep the energy cells for yourself (No more missions from Mr Hedra) or tell the vault leader about Mr Hedra's plans (Hedra Tower becomes hostile toward the player)
- Mr Hedra is very happy with the player. You've done everything he's asked and made a bit of money for yourself as well. Now is when you start to feel real power- taking the life of another. I have someone in the vault that needs to be silenced. Speak to Saxton Hale and learn that your target is Cynthiaa. When you find her in her living quarters you have the option to assassinate her for 1000 credits or warn Cynthiaa that Mr Hedra wants her dead and Cynthia gives you her .44 magnum with some ammo. If you warn her Hedra tower becomes hostile to you.
